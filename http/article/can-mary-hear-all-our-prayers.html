    <h3>Can Mary Hear All Our Prayers?</h3>
    <p>A common question I hear about praying to Mary is, <italics>"With so many people praying to her at the same time, in all these different languages, how could she possibly hear them all?"</italics> It's a fair question, and it makes sense if we think about things in our own human way. But faith is a beautiful thing, and sometimes it goes beyond what our brains can totally wrap their heads around.</p>

<p>Think about this. In the book of Revelation, chapter 5, verse 13, John the Apostle has a wild vision of heaven. In this vision, he hears <italics>"every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea" praising God (Revelation 5:13)</italics>. Imagine the noise! Every single living thing, all at once, in every language! This verse shows us that there's a whole other reality out there, one that works differently than our world. John, even though he's a Saint, a regular human like us, was able to experience this amazing chorus of praise from everywhere.</p>

<p>If we say Mary can't hear all our prayers because there are just too many of them, or because they're all in different languages, then wouldn't that be the same as saying the Bible itself is wrong? John the Apostle still had his incredible vision of heaven <italics>(Revelation 5:13)</italics>, and he hears everyone praising God – every single person and creature, all at once, no matter where they are or what language they speak.</p>

<p>This shows us that heaven works differently than our world. If John could experience this amazing chorus of praise from everywhere, then Mary, who's up in heaven with God and full of grace, can also be aware of all the prayers people offer to her, even if we can't quite understand how it works.</p><p>Of course, Mary's not God. She doesn't know everything like He does. But God lets Mary experience our prayers in a special way, even though they come from all over the world. After all, Mary is the Mother of Jesus, closer to Him than anyone else. It makes sense that God might give her this special ability to hear our prayers and intercede for us.</p>

<p>Really, prayer is all about faith. We open our hearts to God, trusting that He hears us even if we can't explain how. In the same way, we can trust that Mary, in her special place in heaven, hears our prayers too. It doesn't take away from God being the one who truly hears and answers our prayers. Instead, it shows us how much God loves us and how He uses people like Mary to help us – like a kind of bridge between our everyday lives and His amazing grace. Through prayer, we connect with both God and Mary, receiving their love and support on our journey.</p>
